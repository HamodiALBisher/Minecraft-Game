# 2D Minecraft Game (Vanilla JavaScript)

## Project Description
This project is a simplified 2D version of a Minecraft-style game built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.  
The game allows the player to interact with a 2D world made of different block types, collect blocks using tools, store them in an inventory, and place them back into the world.

The project focuses on DOM manipulation, game logic, and modular JavaScript structure without using external libraries or frameworks.
